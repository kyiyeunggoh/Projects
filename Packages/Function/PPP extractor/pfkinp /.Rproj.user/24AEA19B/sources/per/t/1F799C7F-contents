# findppp

The goal of findppp is to extract out useful purchasing power parity information from an online repository updated by the OECD. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of findppp from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("findppp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#I want to call the PPP of Australia in 1999

findppp("AUS","1999")

#NOTE: PPP information is based on NATUSD (or based of the USD)
```

To find a full repository of OECD data, just download a related library using install.packages("OECD").
